Spring Boot Microservices Architecture with API Gateway & Config Server

The SpringbootMicroservice project by Manju Vasanth is a Java-based microservices architecture built with Spring Boot. It comprises several key components:

API Gateway: Acts as a single entry point for client requests, routing them to the appropriate microservices.

Config Server: Centralizes external configurations for the microservices, promoting consistency and ease of management.

Department Service: Handles operations related to department entities.

Employee Service: Manages employee-related functionalities.
